        <li><strong>Eurasian Curlew (Numenius arquata)</strong>: Found in coastal regions, especially during migration.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Migratory Birds</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sanderling (Calidris alba)</strong>: Seen during the winter months along the beaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Crab Plover (Dromas ardeola)</strong>: Notable for its unique nesting habits on sandy beaches.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Sea Birds</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>White Tern (Gygis alba)</strong>: Known for its graceful flight and pure white plumage.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Noddy (Anous stolidus)</strong>: Frequently seen around the coral islands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Marine Biodiversity of Lakshadweep</h2>
    
    <h3>Coral Species</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acropora spp.</strong>: Includes various species, essential for reef building.</li>
        <li><strong>Pocillopora damicornis</strong>: Known for its bushy structure and pink coloration.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Fish Species</h3>
    
    <h4>Reef Fishes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Parrotfish (Scaridae)</strong>: Important for reef health as they feed on algae.</li>
        <li><strong>Butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae)</strong>: Known for their colorful appearance and intricate patterns.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Pelagic Fishes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tuna (Thunnini)</strong>: Vital for both the ecosystem and local fishing industry.</li>
